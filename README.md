MongoDB (Mongoose) is set up along with Express. Mongo is set up in memory so
any time you restart your server you'll lose your data.

You're free to use another database than Mongo or web framework than express
but they're set up to minimize the amount of work required.

The `index.js` file sets up the project. You can use `app.js` to write your code.

The task is expected to take 2-5 hours to complete.
